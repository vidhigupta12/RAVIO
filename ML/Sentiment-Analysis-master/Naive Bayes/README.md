# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes
We will be implementing Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. 
Specifically we will cover: 

* Training a naive bayes model on a sentiment analysis task
* Test using our model
* Compute ratios of positive words to negative words
* Do some error analysis
* Predict on your own tweet


* We will use the ratio of probabilities between positive and negative sentiments and this approach gives us simpler formulas for these 2-way classification tasks.
